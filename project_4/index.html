            Here is a thing you will learn about. We hope. Well, even if you
            don't learn, we will blather on, and make this page function. This
            page is about a collection of code tools that are completely
            unrelated in any way, and don't function together in the slightest.
            So learn or burn. The goals are to learn as follows:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>something</li>
            <li>something else</li>
            <li>watermelon, watermelon, watermelon</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="dog_food" class="main-section">
          <header>dog_food</header>

          <p>
            Like every good code tool, this one has a good name. It's impossible
            to imagine what a tool might be with such a name, but if you try,
            and take a mind-altering drug, surely you will come up laughing.
          </p>

          <code>
            start; <br />
            loop; <br />
            stop; <br />
            poop; <br />
            // dogfood makes everything go. <br />
          </code>

          <p>Lorem, lorem, lorem.</p>

            Do you have Imposter Syndrome? Here is a gruesome tool that will do
            away with your problem. Use it when you determine your code is an
            utter failure.
          </p>

          <p>
            First run:
            <code>

            Second run:

          <p>
            hut_sut is a nonsense program, that inserts the following song.
            Anytime you just can't stand your employer, install this little
            nugget, and enjoy the corruption of a variety of files, regardless
            of the protections installed.

            Words and music by Leo V. Killion, Ted Mcmichael & Jack Owens<br /><br />

            In a town in Sweden by a stream so clear and cool<br />
            A boy would sit and fish and dream when he should have been in
            school.<br />
            Now, he couldn't read or write a word but happiness he found<br />
            In a little song he heard and here's how it would sound;<br />

            Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit,<br />
            Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla sooit.<br />
            Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit,<br />
            Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla sooit.<br />

            Now the Rawlson is a Swedish town, the rillerah is a stream.<br />
            The brawla is the boy and girl,<br />
            The Hut-Sut is their dream.<br />

            Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit.<br />
            Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla sooit <br />

          <p>
            knuckle_dragger is a component you can use to identify thick-headed
            users on your web page. Upon detection, knuckle_dragger makes
            everylink go to the same place, provoking the user to smash his
            computer. Cookies track him, and, by-golly, you can find him, and
            sell him a faulty computer that has more knuckle-dragger tricks in
            its bag.

          <p>
            knuckle_dragger has been successfully installed with a variety of
            hacker tools you probably have already used.
