                <p>Here is a thing you will learn about.  We hope.  
                    Well, even if you don't learn, we will blather on, and make this page function.  
                    This page is about a collection of code tools that are completely unrelated
                    in any way, and don't function together in the slightest.  So learn or burn.  
                    The goals are to learn as follows: 
                </p>

                Like every good code tool, this one has a good name.  It's impossible to imagine
                what a tool might be with such a name, but if you try, and take a mind-altering drug, 
                surely you will come up laughing.

                    hut_sut is a nonsense program, that inserts the following song.  Anytime you just can't stand your employer, 
                    install this little nugget, and enjoy the corruption of a variety of files,

                    knuckle_dragger is a component you can use to identify thick-headed users on your
                    web page.  Upon detection, knuckle_dragger makes everylink go to the same place,
                    provoking the user to smash his computer.  Cookies track him, and, by-golly, you can find him, and
                    sell him a faulty computer that has more knuckle-dragger tricks in its bag.
