            <p>Here is a thing you will learn about.  We hope.  
                Well, even if you don't learn, we will blather on, and make this page function.  
                This page is about a collection of code tools that are completely unrelated
                in any way, and don't function together in the slightest.  So learn or burn.  
                The goals are to learn as follows: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>something</li>
                <li>something else</li>
                <li>watermelon, watermelon, watermelon</li>

            Like every good code tool, this one has a good name.  It's impossible to imagine
            what a tool might be with such a name, but if you try, and take a mind-altering drug, 
            surely you will come up laughing.

            <p>
            Do you have Imposter Syndrome?  Here is a gruesome tool that will do away with your problem.  
            Use it when you determine your code is an utter failure.

            <p>
                hut_sut is a nonsense program, that inserts the following song.  Anytime you just can't stand your employer, 
                install this little nugget, and enjoy the corruption of a variety of files, 
                regardless of the protections installed.

                Words and music by Leo V. Killion, Ted Mcmichael & Jack Owens

                In a town in Sweden by a stream so clear and cool
                A boy would sit and fish and dream when he should have been in school.
                Now, he couldn't read or write a word but happiness he found
                In a little song he heard and here's how it would sound;
                
                Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit,
                Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla sooit.
                Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit,
                Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla sooit.
                
                Now the Rawlson is a Swedish town, the rillerah is a stream.
                The brawla is the boy and girl,
                The Hut-Sut is their dream.
                
                Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla, brawla sooit.
                Hut-Sut Rawlson on the rillerah and a brawla sooit

            <p>
                knuckle_dragger is a component you can use to identify thick-headed users on your
                web page.  Upon detection, knuckle_dragger makes everylink go to the same place,
                provoking the user to smash his computer.  Cookies track him, and, by-golly, you can find him, and
                sell him a faulty computer that has more knuckle-dragger tricks in its bag.
